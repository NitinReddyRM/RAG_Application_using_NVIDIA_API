# RAG_Application_using_NVIDIA_API
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application using NVIDIA APIs refers to a system where LLMs (Large Language Models) are enhanced with external knowledge retrieval. NVIDIA provides optimized AI models (like those in NVIDIA NeMo, TensorRT-LLM, and RAPIDS AI) that help accelerate and deploy RAG pipelines efficiently.
